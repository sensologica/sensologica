Hi there!

I'm Artem. I'm a web developer.

Currently I am one of the core contributors at [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) where I get to work with amazing people and build a privacy-first open-source Markdown editor. Our mission is to help students and knowledge-workers shape novel ideas at the speed of thought.

I spend the rest of my time improving my React and TypeScript skills, learning more about how to build full-stack apps, and looking for my first full-time job as a web developer. If you are hiring, feel free to get in touch.

You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sensologica) and follow me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/sensologica.bsky.social) for an occasional insightful post wrapped in a bad joke ;) Or read my [blog](https://www.artembarinov.com/blog).

See you around!
