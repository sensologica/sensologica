Hi there!

I'm Artem. I'm a product designer who loves to code and tinker with all things web.

I run Sensologica -- my web design and development studio -- from the beautiful city of Paris.

I am also a core contributor at [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) where I get to work with amazing people and build a privacy-first open-source Markdown editor. Our mission is to help knowledge workers shape novel ideas at the speed of thought.

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sensologica) and follow me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/sensologica.bsky.social) for an occasional insightful post wrapped in a bad joke ;)

See you around!
