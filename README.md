Hi there! 

I'm Artem. I'm a product designer who loves UX, code, and all things web.

I run Sensologica, my web design and development studio in Paris. Send me a message to set up a free consultation.

Since 2023 I am also a UX designer at [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/), where I get to work with amazing people and help build a privacy-first Markdown editor that helps knowledge workers shape ideas at the speed of thought.

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sensologica) and follow me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/sensologica.bsky.social).

See you around!
